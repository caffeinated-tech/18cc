    <h1>About 18cc</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
    	18cc is a website about giving back to the community. 
    	When it comes to software design and development, nothing can beat the amazing community that
    	has been built up online. From open source projects and communities, to personal blogs and right 
    	through to service providers enticing new costumers with free resources - there is a wealth of
    	information out there for free. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	With 18cc, we want to give back to the community. Usually this means specializing - zeroing in on a
    	niche and becoming the subject expert in your field. But there are so many facets to software, we 
    	couldn't just pick one. Technologies are constantly evolving, and we just love dabbling in new toolsets
    	and frameworks. Instead, 18cc is designed to be a collection of information, articles and witicisms 
    	from all of software development.

    <h2>What's in a name?</h2>

    	18 Caret Code is a word play on 18 karet gold. The purity of gold is measured in 
    	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fineness#Karat">karat</a> (or carat, but not to be confused 
  		with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carat_(mass)">carat</a>), which equals to parts out of 24. 
  		So 24 karat gold would be 100% gold, while 18 karat gold contains around 75% gold in an alloy with 25%
  		other metals (eg. silver or copper).
    </p>
    <p> 
    	The caret (^, also lovingly called U+2038), usually located above the number 6 on UK/US keyboards, is a 
    	common symbol used in programming and maths. It is often your number one friend in regular expressions, 
    	can raise a number to a power, perform a bitwise XOR, concatenate strings and access reference types. 

    	It's a character which deserves more recognition, and to stand among the greats that are XML's angle 
    	brackets and JQuery's $ symbol.

    <p>
      <b>Why 18?</b> It is a popular purity for golden jewellery, as it offers a high purity, but also durability
      thanks to the other metals it is alloyed with. Pure 24 karat gold is too soft and pliable to be practical,
      while lower karats (14, 10 etc.) are less valuable and can cause allergic reactions. In short, 18 karat
      is the sweetspot.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an analogy we want to carry over from goldsmithing to software development. As developers we
      want to work with pure, high grade code (24 karat). But it's not practical. It's slow and expensive to
      write and becomes brittle the more it is worked. That is why we make a compromise. Between beautiful, 
      well-written code and practical, easily modifiable and hard wearing solutions.
